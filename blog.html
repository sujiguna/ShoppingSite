							<h1>OUR PICKS | 12.4</h1>
							<h2>Here’s what we’re obsessing over this week!</h2>
							<p>After owning a boutique for almost 8 years, I’ve heard it all. I have women who come in on a daily basis and say the same things to me. I have always been very honest in my answers. Here are some “truth-be-tolds” from a shop owner’s perspective:</p>

                            <h3>ONE | “I’m too old to wear that.”</h3>

<p>It’s not about your age, it’s about your style. Now, I’m not saying an 80-year-old woman should wear a crop top. I am saying that people can choose to wear things that are age appropriate. I have customers of all ages and I love it. My favorites are the older women, who come in and try things on and rock them. For sure, there are people who shouldn’t wear certain things and think they look good. My take on it is kind of the same of those American Idol auditions that are horrible. Didn’t anyone who loves you tell you that you were awful?! If you don’t have someone in your life that you can be honest with you, go find one now. But until then, if you’re an older gal, who just enjoys wearing adorable clothes — keep rocking it, because you’re awesome.<p>

                            <h3>TWO | “Nothing in here is going to fit me.”</h3>

<p>Did you try anything on? Most likely, no. It’s the common assumption from glancing at the rack or mannequins. A well-known not-so-secret, the smalls are in the front of a rack and on the mannequins. There are other sizes! Some vendors may not carry up to an XL, but some do run a bit on the larger scale. Moral of the story, don’t assume. Because we all know what happens when you assume. Try it on, what’s the worst that could happen? You were right? Either way, you’re leaving feeling good about yourself because you were right or you found something that looks good. Win-win.</p>

                            <h3>THREE | “Where would I wear this?”</h3>

<p>To church. To the grocery store. Hell, to the dump! Sometimes, we need to step outside of the box and our closets. If you are in love with something, but just don’t know where you would wear it, buy it. 9 times out of 10, you’re going to have an occasion that you wished you picked it up for — at which point you would go and buy something for it anyway.</p>

                            <h1>Stepping into the new year!</h1>
							<h2>YES, EVEN Kanavu Illam HAS NEW YEARS RESOLUTIONS</h2>
							<p>We have BIG plans for 2018! The past year has been a year of learning. Learning the business, getting to know our customers and getting our feet underneath us at this whole running a business thing. Well, it’s almost been a year since we re-opened and we couldn’t be more excited to implement some of the ideas we’ve had from the very beginning.</p>
                            <p>Before you worry that Trend won’t be the same, let us set that record straight. Your favorite lines (Caldrea, Illume, Creative Co-op, etc.) will still be here. We simply are ADDING to what we already have and getting a new look. The same store you know and love – with more options, sizes and novelties! Sounds like a good plan, huh? We think so.<br>Here is what you can look forward to in the upcoming year!</p>

"Kanavu Illam was superfast. I ordered on 26th Dec and today (28th Dec) I got the product. I also got a call yesterday by the Gharpay executive before coming for the pick up, as committed by Team Kanavu Illam. I Ordered Pearl Necklace. The design and specially the color of the pearlwhich I was specific to be the same as mentioned in the website was perfectly the same. Moreover, It looks amazingly beautiful with my Royal Blue and Pink Saree. Very happy with the service. Keep it up Kanavu Illam ! All the Best ! "
