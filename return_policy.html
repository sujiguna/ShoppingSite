					<h2>About us <span>> Return Policy</span></h2>
				
					<h3>Seller Return Policy</h3>
					<p>When you order from a seller that fulfills and ships its own inventory (also called a third party seller), your return is sent back to the seller instead of Amazon.com. While most sellers offer a returns policy equivalent to Amazon.com's, some seller returns policies may vary. You can view the return policy of the seller before you purchase an item by viewing the Returns and Refunds Policy section of the seller profile page. To view the seller's return policy, once you've ordered, you can select your order in the Online Returns Center.</p>

<p>Third-party sellers must either provide a return address within the United States, provide a prepaid return label, or offer a full refund without requesting the item be returned. If a seller does not offer these methods to return your items, you may file an A-to-z Guarantee claim to seek help with your return.</p>

<p>If you are sending the item within the United States and the order is valued at $100 or more, insure the shipment for the value of the merchandise and ship your return with a signature shipping service. Items valued over $35 must be returned to the seller with a trackable shipping service. For items below $35, we suggest USPS delivery confirmation service. If a package doesn't arrive and you don't use a trackable method to return or if you refuse the shipment as a method of return, we may not be able to cover you under the A-to-z Guarantee.</p>
                    <h3>Clothing and Accessories</h3>
                    <p>You can return clothing and accessories up to 30 days after the delivery date.</li>
                        Free Returns are available for select clothing. You'll see "Free Returns" messaging on the detail page for items that qualify.</p>

"Kanavu Illam was superfast. I ordered on 26th Dec and today (28th Dec) I got the product. I also got a call yesterday by the Gharpay executive before coming for the pick up, as committed by Team Kanavu Illam. I Ordered Pearl Necklace. The design and specially the color of the pearlwhich I was specific to be the same as mentioned in the website was perfectly the same. Moreover, It looks amazingly beautiful with my Royal Blue and Pink Saree. Very happy with the service. Keep it up Kanavu Illam ! All the Best ! "
